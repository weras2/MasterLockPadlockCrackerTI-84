# So, how do I use this? 

### A: It's really simple. All you have to do is supply three inputs to the program. 


# First Input 

### Corresponds to the number the lock is stuck in after pulling the shack lightly and moving the dial in a counter clockwise manner 

# Second Input

### Also corresponds to the number the lock is stuck in after pulling the shack lightly and moving the dial in a counter clockwise manner

## Note: Both second and first inputs are numbers UNDER 20 

# Third Input

### Corresponds to the number the lock is stuck in after pulling slightly harder than the force used in the forst two inputs and the dial is moved in either clockwise or counter clockwise manner

## Note: You can exclude 0

# The Output

## The first line indicates the first number
## The second line indicates possible candidates for the second number
## The thid line indicates possible candidates for the third number
